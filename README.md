# üìö Ara3D-SDK

[![NuGet Version](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/Ara3D.SDK)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Ara3D.SDK)

**Ara3D-SDK** is a powerful collection of open-source C# libraries for processing, transforming, and visualizing large-scale 3D models‚Äîespecially tailored for AEC (Architecture, Engineering, and Construction) workflows.

Use it standalone, or extend and customize the **Ara 3D Studio** desktop application.

Designed for high performance and scalability, the libraries handle massive 3D data sets in real-time. They're cross-platform and compatible with .NET 8.

## üñ•Ô∏è Ara 3D Studio

**Ara 3D Studio** is a Windows desktop application included in this repository as a pre-built binary (`Ara3D.Studio.exe`). It allows you to:

- View, import, and export large-scale 3D models
- Create and manipulate geometry interactively
- Extend functionality via plugins and scripting

Once registered, the software is free to use for any purpose, including commercial work.

‚û°Ô∏è To get started, download and run `Ara3D.Studio.exe` from the `dist/` folder.

## üñáÔ∏è Dependencies 

The core **Ara3D.SDK** package is .NET 8 compatible, cross-platform,  
and uses only the following external Nuget libraries:

- Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp - 4.8.0
- Microsoft.DiaSymReader.Native - 1.7.0
- System.Memory - 4.6.0

The test projects and samples are windows-specific and use NUnit 3 and executables found 
in the `dist` folder.

The auto-generated code from Plato uses projects found in the toolchain folder. 
They are not run automatically, and are not currently supported.
